# Drop & Upload Files

Codes for a tutorial on how to create a simple Drop & Upload Files application in Javascript using FileReader and XMLHttpRequest with React.

## Tutorial

This repository is for the step-by-step tutorialson how to build a Drop & Uoload application. The purpose of this tutorial is to get you familiar with FileReader, XMLHttpRequest (Ajax), and most of all React. The codes and the tutorials are for someone who want to learn the basic of those technologies. You willd find these tutorials and codes boring if you are already an expert in React. The jQuery is never used in the tutorials to meet the trend of the current Javascript application development.

- Step 1: Pure Javascript
- Step 2: Ajax with Express
- Step 3: React, Webpack, Express

In step 3, you will build a simple React application writing in ES2015 syntax along with the support of Babel and Webpack.
