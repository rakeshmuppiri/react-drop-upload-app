# Tutorial: React Drop & Upload App

Codes for a tutorial on how to create a simple Drop & Upload Files application in Javascript using FileReader and XMLHttpRequest with React.

## Tutorial

This repository is for the step-by-step tutorials on how to build a Drop & Upload application. The purpose of this tutorial is to get you familiar with FileReader, XMLHttpRequest (Ajax), and most of all React.

The tutorials are intended for someone who want to learn the basic of those technologies. You will find these tutorials and codes boring if you are already an expert in Javascript and React. The jQuery is never used in the tutorials in order to meet the trend of the current Javascript application development.

The official tutorials are available on my personal website Mokuji. 

- Step 1: [Pure Javascript](https://www.mokuji.me/article/drop-upload-tutorial-1)
- Step 2: [Ajax with Express.js](https://www.mokuji.me/article/drop-upload-tutorial-2)
- Step 3: [React-ify with Babel & webpack](https://www.mokuji.me/article/drop-upload-tutorial-3)

In step 3, you will build a simple React application writing in ES2015 syntax along with the support of Babel and Webpack.

## Prerequisite

- Node.js & NPM installed
- Basic knowledge in Javascript including server-side
- Basic knowledge in ES2015
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (Unnecessary, replaceable with npm)
- (Globally Nodemon)

Although the prior experience in Javascript for both front & backend is preferable, this tutorials can be a good place to start with JS.
